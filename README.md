# Introduction
BumWings is an ergonomic keyboard design that uses the Waveshare RP2040-zero board which features a Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU.   It is my first attempt at an all-new keyboard PCB design, but obviously it has been influenced by many other keyboard designs (both open-source, closed-source and commercial).

## Design and Implementation

BumWings uses an "un-split" angled ergonomic matrix that has columnar stagger with moderate pinky splay, and features dual inverted T-clusters and modest thumb key clusters.  It is a fairly large board that also gives space for the hands to stay apart and rest at an angle, which works well for me.

The Waveshare RP2040-zero board can either be soldered directly, or socketed pin headers can alternately be used.

Kailh "Choc" PG1350 key switches are used.  The board can either be used bare (not recommended) or installed in a case.  I will soon upload a set of PCB case files for a Corne-style board arrangement (with both top plate and bottom plate).
