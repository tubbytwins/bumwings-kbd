# V001

I used JLCPCB to build the first prototype PCBs for this version.  It works nicely.

See "info.md" for more information about the background and inspiration for this keyboard design.


## List of Variants

*   "pcb_core52840" - 54-key hot-swap PCB based on the Waveshare Core52840 module
*   "pcb_rp2040zero" - 54-key hot-swap PCB based on Waveshare RP2040 "zero" controller
*   "pcb_xiao" - 54-key hot-swap PCB based on the Seeed Xiao controller
*   "pcb_xiao_s" - simplified 54-key direct-soldered PCB based on the Seeed Xiao controller

## Bill of Materials

## All variants

Diodes:  54x D_SOD-123

Sockets:  54x Kailh Choc hot-swap (for all variants except "pcb_xiao_s") (again, you will need 54 of them)

Key caps:  MBK (either plain, or with legends, at your discretion)

Other resistors/etc:  none



### Waveshare RP2040 variant

MCU:     Waveshare RP2040 "zero" (23-pin module with USB-C port) - you can find these on Amazon for a higher price, or on Aliexpress or eBay for a lower price.  They can either be plain, or with pre-soldered pin headers.

### Xiao Seeed variant

MCU:     Xiao Seeed controller of your choice - you can find these from many suppliers

Shift Register:  2x 74HC595PW or SN74HC595PW (in TSSOP-16 format) - you can find these from many suppliers, usually around USD $1.50 for a pack of 10

Reset switch and power switch:  optional, stay tuned...


### Xiao Seeed Simplified variant

MCU:    Xiao Seeed controller (as above)

Shift Register:  2x 74HC595PW or SN74HC595PW (in TSSOP-16 format)

No reset or power switch.  This variant is intended for non-wireless (and non-battery-powered) builds.  The Xiao Seeed RP2040 controller works very well for this variant, and I expect that the SAMD21 controller would also work very well.

For this variant, all components are direct-soldered to the front of the PCB (except the key switches, obviously).


### Waveshare Core52840 variant

MCU:     Waveshare Core52840 module, featuring Nordic Semiconductor's nRF52840

Alternate: HolyIOT 18010 module (which is apparently pin-compatible...)

Other components as follows:  (based heavily on Rafael Yumagulov's "Dao-Choc-BLE" board, but I replaced all 0603-size components with 1206-size components, to make it easier for hand-soldering)

In the Dao-Choc-BLE design, the designer offered an alternate value of 820k for "R5"; however, for such a voltage sensing circuit (for battery status) a resistor of 820k will give somewhat invalid values.  In my design, I opted to use two resistors that added up to 806k, which is the recommended value.

**RPROG**** Value depends on your battery capacity. For 300mAh battery should be 3.3K
